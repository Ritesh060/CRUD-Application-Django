# CRUD-Application-Django
A CRUD application with Django as backend. It also uses SQL as the database.

## How it works?
It makes frontend using HTML and CSS bootstrap. It is connected to the backend using Django. It updates whatever data it takes directly to the SQL database.
The database is accessible using [this](https://github.com/Ritesh060/CRUD-Application-Django/blob/main/db.sqlite3) file.

```
Then click on the link made in the terminal and run the site.
